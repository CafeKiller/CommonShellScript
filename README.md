# CommonShellScript

This is my own use of some shell scripts, some are collected from the web, not entirely original;  
These scripts are mainly used on the linux platform, but some are used on windows;  
These scripts do not do compatibility processing, if you need to use, try to use on the specified system or platform  

> Pay attention! Some of the parameters in the script do not have general processing, it needs to be modified, if you need to use please note this, and then modify it yourself.
